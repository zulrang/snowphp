# Snow PHP MVC Framework

*Snow* was developed as an extremely lightweight, flexible, and extensible MVC framework for PHP to be used it very restrictive environments

It has no dependencies outside of PHP itself and works great with Oracle (unlike many PHP frameworks)

So far it only has one contributor (Roger Collins) but is being used by a few others and is currently running in production systems.
